Water treatment remains the largest segment, driven by the escalating need for clean and safe drinking water. PAC is extensively utilized in municipal and industrial water treatment facilities to remove organic contaminants, chlorine, and other impurities, ensuring the delivery of high-quality water. In addition, the demand for PAC in wastewater treatment is on the rise, particularly in areas with stringent environmental regulations aimed at minimizing pollutants and safeguarding aquatic ecosystems. The air treatment segment also demonstrates substantial growth, with PAC being employed in air filtration systems to capture and eliminate volatile organic compounds (VOCs), odors, and other airborne pollutants. This application is crucial in maintaining air quality and adhering to environmental standards across various industries, including automotive and manufacturing.</p><p>Furthermore, the industrial application of PAC is notable, particularly in processes such as gold recovery, pharmaceutical manufacturing, and food and beverage processing. In gold recovery, PAC is used in the cyanidation process to extract gold from ores, enhancing the efficiency and yield of the extraction process. In the pharmaceutical industry, PAC plays a critical role in ensuring the purity of active ingredients and excipients by removing contaminants during drug manufacturing. Additionally, the food and beverage sector leverages PAC for decolorization and purification purposes, such as in the production of sugar, juices, and edible oils.
