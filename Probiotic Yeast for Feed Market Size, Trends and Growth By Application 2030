One of the prominent applications is in the poultry industry, where probiotic yeast is utilized to enhance gut health and overall performance of birds. The inclusion of probiotic yeast in poultry feed helps in improving nutrient absorption, reducing gastrointestinal infections, and promoting better growth rates. This is crucial for poultry farmers aiming to increase productivity while minimizing the need for antibiotics. Additionally, probiotic yeast supports the development of beneficial gut flora, which is essential for maintaining the health and efficiency of poultry operations.</p><p>Another key application of probiotic yeast is in the aquaculture industry. Here, probiotic yeast is incorporated into fish and shrimp feed to boost immune function, improve disease resistance, and enhance growth rates.
